# Linux Server Configuration
Configuring an Ubuntu 16 LTS server to host a Flask application via Apache web server.

This is the sixth and final project for the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. The
 goal is to use Amazon Lightsail to deploy a functional web application on the public internet. The objective is to learn how to configure a Linux web server in a secure and functional fashion.
