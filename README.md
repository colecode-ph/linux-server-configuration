# Linux Server Configuration
Configuring an Ubuntu 16 LTS server to host a Flask application via Apache web server.

This is the sixth and final project for the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. The
 goal is to use Amazon Lightsail to deploy a functional web application on the public internet.
 
The application hosted is actually one of the previous Udacity projects, in this case a book catalog CRUD application built with the python Flask application framework, and the PostgreSQL database server.
